### Core Intelligence Layers

**Standard Research (Free/Pro)**
Renders 307,000+ real parcel boundaries on an interactive Mapbox map. Includes ownership, assessed values, zoning, deed history, legal descriptions, and LLC entity lookups sourced from Gwinnett County ArcGIS services.

**Site Intelligence (Pro/Enterprise)**
Adds AI-powered site scoring, zoning analysis chat, comparable sales, firm activity history, and a one-click investment brief generator powered by Claude AI with structured streaming responses.

**Data Center Mode (Pro/Enterprise)**
A specialized workflow for data center site selection. Every parcel is scored across power, fiber, water, and environmental risk—validated against live federal HIFLD data. Includes multi-site comparison tables and **Site Scout**: an AI-powered discovery tool.

**Firm Intelligence (Enterprise)**
A proprietary platform layer for multi-tenant CRM, deal pipeline tracking, and internal project management, linking parcels directly to firm-wide outcomes.

## Technical Architecture

- **Unified Application**: Consolidated all experimental phases into a single `/map` route with an adaptive UI.
- **Feature Flag System**: Granular control over high-value features (AI, DC, CRM) via the Zustand store and a dedicated Settings Modal.
- **Membership Simulation**: Built-in tier presets (Free, Pro, Enterprise) to demonstrate tiered value propositions.
- **Dark-Mode Only**: A custom design system optimized for high-density data visualization.

---

## Tech Stack

- **Next.js 16** (App Router, Turbopack dev server)
- **Mapbox GL JS** via `react-map-gl/mapbox` — parcel polygons, zoning overlays, infrastructure layers, scout overlays
- **Zustand** — single-store state management with persistence for user preferences and feature flags
- **Supabase** — saved parcels, collections, and multi-tenant CRM (PostgreSQL + RLS)
- **Anthropic Claude API** — site scoring narratives, zoning chat, investment briefs, DC scoring, Site Scout geographic reasoning
- **Tailwind CSS 4** — dark-mode-only design system with custom CSS variables

## Data Sources

| Source | What It Provides |
|--------|-----------------|
| Gwinnett County ArcGIS — Parcels (Layer 0) | 307,811 polygon boundaries, PIN, address, acreage |
| Gwinnett County ArcGIS — Zoning (Layer 1) | 12,593 zoning district polygons with classification codes |
| Gwinnett County ArcGIS — Property & Tax (Layer 3) | Owner, assessed values, land use, deed refs, legal descriptions |
| HIFLD Electric Substations (ArcGIS FeatureServer) | Substation locations, voltage, operator — used for DC power scoring |
| HIFLD Electric Transmission Lines (ArcGIS FeatureServer) | TX line geometry — used for corridor scoring |
| Mapbox Geocoding API | Place-based search and navigation |

Parcels and zoning load dynamically by viewport bounding box. Infrastructure data is fetched on demand when DC mode is active.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- Mapbox account (map token)
- Supabase project (saved parcels/collections)
- Anthropic API key (Phase 2 and 3 AI features)

### Environment Variables

Create `.env.local`:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_MAPBOX_TOKEN=your_mapbox_token
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_key
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

`NEXTAUTH_URL` is used by the DC Scout area-search route to self-call the dc-score API for batch parcel scoring.

### Install and Run

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). The landing page links to all three phases. The map defaults to Gwinnett County at zoom 14 — zoom past 13 to see parcel boundaries appear.

### Database Setup

```bash
# Via Supabase CLI
supabase db push

# Or run the SQL directly in the Supabase SQL Editor
# File: supabase/migrations/20260221000000_dev_saved_parcels.sql
```

The migration uses `TEXT` user IDs (default: `dev-user`) so it works without Supabase Auth configured.

## Commands

```bash
npm run dev          # Start dev server (Turbopack)
npm run build        # Production build
npm run start        # Serve production build
npx eslint .         # Lint (ESLint 9 flat config)
npx tsc --noEmit     # Type check
```

## Feature Status

### Phase 1 — CRE Research ✅ Complete

- Real parcel boundaries from Gwinnett County (307K+ parcels, loaded by viewport)
- Two-step click flow: instant preview card → full property panel on demand
- Property details: ownership, assessed values, land use, zoning, deed references, legal descriptions
- Zoning overlay with county-specific color mapping (C1–C3, R60/R75/R100, M1/M2, MU, TND, etc.)
- Search by owner name, PIN, or address against county tax records
- Mapbox geocoding for place-based navigation
- Saved parcels and named collections (Supabase-backed, persists across sessions)
- LLC/entity ownership lookup
- Desktop panel (380px slide-in) + mobile drawer (Vaul)
- Layer toggles: parcels, parcel fill, zoning, saved pins, road labels
- Multiple base map styles: streets, satellite, light, dark

### Phase 2 — Site Intelligence ✅ Complete

- AI site scoring with weighted criteria (access, zoning, utilities, size) — Claude Haiku
- AI zoning analysis: plain-English summary of current zoning, permitted uses, variances — streaming
- Zoning AI chat for follow-up questions on any parcel
- Comparable sales: nearby sold parcels with price, $/SF, distance
- Firm activity history: LLC ownership patterns and associated entity graph
- Investment brief generator: one-click AI narrative covering deal thesis, risk, and comps — streaming
- Phase 2 tabs live on the Phase 1 dashboard via the same panel

### Phase 3 — Data Center Mode ✅ Complete

**DC Parcel Scoring**
- Composite DC suitability score (0–100) with sub-scores: Power, Fiber, Water, Environmental
- Power tab: nearest substation distance, voltage (kV), operator, transmission line access, estimated available capacity
- Fiber tab: proximity to carrier exchange points, estimated dark fiber availability, latency zone
- Water tab: cooling water availability, watershed, municipal service area, flood zone
- Environmental tab: FEMA flood zone, 100/500-year risk, seismic zone, climate risk factors
- Disqualification flags for hard blockers (flood zone AE/VE, no substation within 20 miles, etc.)
- All infrastructure data validated against live HIFLD federal datasets

**Multi-Site Comparison**
- Add up to 4 parcels to a comparison tray (bottom-docked)
- Full-screen comparison table: all five score dimensions side-by-side, best/worst highlighting
- AI consultant narrative streaming from `/api/dc-brief/compare` — winner, differentiators, risk flags

**Site Scout — AI Discovery**
- Tier 1 (Open Discovery): Describe a project in natural language → Claude identifies candidate sub-markets using geographic reasoning → HIFLD validates real substation data at each location → ranked results with rationale streamed back
- Tier 2 (Area Search): Pick a sub-market or use current map view → batch-scores all viable parcels in the bbox → full DC score on top 5 → numbered map pins with color-coded results
- Sub-market bbox overlays appear on the map as dashed rectangles during Tier 1
- Example queries: hyperscale I-85 corridor, edge deployment near fiber exchange, low-flood-risk Alabama site

## Design System

Dark-mode only. Custom CSS variables in `globals.css`:

- **Surfaces**: `--ink` through `--ink4` (darkest → lightest background)
- **Accent**: `--teal` (#00d4c8) — interactive elements, standard mode
- **Secondary**: `--amber` (#f5a623) — saved items, financial data
- **DC accent**: orange-500 — all Data Center mode elements
- **Fonts**: Bebas Neue (headings/logo), IBM Plex Mono (data labels/values), Barlow (body)

Zoning colors in `constants.ts`: commercial=blue, residential=green, industrial=orange, mixed-use=purple, planned=cyan.
